*****.  Hello,

I'm currently in the process of developing a website for Custom Shed, a company poised to make its mark on the market. 
The site is still under construction, which means some sections aren't fully polished yet.
 I'm actively refining the animations to enhance the user experience. 
 Stay tuned for the finished product, which we aim to deliver to the highest standard very soon.

├── CSS/   └── [stylesheets] (This CSS script defines the main styling rules for a website. 
    It sets up color variables for primary, secondary, light, and dark themes.
    The script also specifies font weights for different header tags and classes,
    creating a consistent typographical hierarchy.
    There's styling for a back-to-top button, a loading spinner, and various button styles, 
    including primary, secondary, square, and tag buttons.

    The navbar, header, and other components like the carousel, modal video, page header,
    and section titles are styled for a cohesive look.
     Specific styling rules are applied to the facts, about, feature, and service sections for visual consistency. 
    The script also includes detailed styling for project displays, skills, appointments, testimonials, coming soon pages, carousels, contact forms, and footers.

    Each section is meticulously designed to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface,
    with responsive design considerations for different screen sizes.
    Also use a Bootstrap libraries)

     ( CSS code defines the styling for a website template, 
    focusing on interactive components like a back-to-top button, 
    offcanvas menus, and a custom accordion. 
    The .back-to-top class sets up a fixed button for easy navigation,
    while .btn-offcanvas and .offcanvas-start style a sidebar menu.
    The .btn-toggle is designed for a collapsible menu with a neat SVG arrow icon that rotates when expanded. 
    The accordion component, under .accordion-custom,
    features custom styling for its items and buttons,
     including color changes and transitions for a more dynamic interaction. 
    This code is essential for creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.)
    
    (Docs.js jQuery script enhances the user experience of a website by implementing several features:

    Smooth Scrolling: When clicking on links in the offcanvas menu, the page scrolls smoothly to the linked section rather than jumping directly to it.
     This is achieved with an animation that takes 1500 milliseconds, using the 'easeInOutExpo' easing function.
    Back to Top Button: A button appears when the user scrolls down the page past a certain point (100 pixels).
     Clicking this button smoothly scrolls the page back to the top, also using an easing animation.
    Code Highlighting: The script processes text within <pre><code></code></pre> tags, trimming and reinserting it to format correctly.
     Then, it applies syntax highlighting using the highlight.js library.
    This script is designed to make the website more interactive and user-friendly, improving navigation and readability.)

    Animate.css: This library provides a wide range of CSS animations, which can be easily applied to HTML elements to create engaging visual effects.
    CounterUp: This is a jQuery plugin used to animate numbers. 
    It's useful for statistics or counters where you want numbers to smoothly count up when they come into view on the page.
    Easing: This library extends jQuery's built-in animation effects.
     It offers additional easing functions, allowing for more sophisticated animations beyond the basic linear or swing animations available in jQuery.)

├── mail/
│   └── [email scripts](Contact Form // /* jQuery script is for a contact form. When the form is submitted, 
    it validates the input fields using jqBootstrapValidation. 
    If the validation passes, it sends the form data (name, email, subject, message) 
    to a PHP script (contact-form.php) via AJAX POST request.
     On success, it displays a success message and resets the form. On failure, it shows an error message.
     The script also re-enables the send button and updates its text after the AJAX call completes.
    Additionally, it clears any alert messages when any form field is focused.*/
    In addition to the previously mentioned features, the website also incorporates the bootstrapValidation.min.js library. 
    This library is used to validate form data on the client side before it is submitted.
     It ensures that all required fields are filled out correctly and that the email address provided is in the correct format.
      This validation process enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback on the form inputs and helps prevent the submission of incorrect or incomplete data.

    PHP script is designed to process a contact form. It first checks if the 'name', 'subject', 'message' 
    fields are filled and the 'email' is valid. If any of these checks fail, 
    it sends a 500 HTTP response code and exits. If the checks pass, 
    it sanitizes the input data to prevent HTML and script injections.
     The script then sets the recipient email, constructs the email subject 
     and body with the provided information, and sets headers. 
     Finally, it attempts to send the email using 
     PHP's mail function and sends a 500 HTTP response code if the email sending fails.)
